					<h1>I'm AShifter.</h1>
					<b>Hello! I'm AShifter. </b><span>I develop things and put them on the internet. Including this website!</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>This website showcases my best GitHub projects. The three tiles on my homepage (which can be accessed from any page by clicking the "ashifter" text at the top) are 
						the projects that I love to devote time to and experiment with. Clicking on any of the tiles will bring you to that project's page which will present you
						with a GitHub README.md file which is grabbed from that repository and parsed into HTML with the <a href="https://www.github.com/showdownjs/showdown">Showdown Markdown Parser</a>.
						Clicking on the README.md text in any project page will bring you to the GitHub repository where you can clone, fork, and contribute.
					</p>
					<h3>MonoHack</h3>
					<p>
						MonoHack is an in-progress game engine built on MonoGame for use with hacking games and general game UI needs. It was born from the ashes of the old ShiftOS project from 2014
						and will hopefully live on to be the most versatile UI toolkit for MonoGame and XNA-based projects.
					</p>
					<h3>WaterBot</h3>
					<p>
						WaterBot is a Discord Bot. Simple! It's completely modular, and gets improved whenever I have the time to work on it. It can't compete with the likes of AstralMod and PrecipitationJS (yet!) 
						but I hope to get it there some day.
					</p>
					<h3>NOU</h3>
					<p>
						I don't know what it is yet. It's some sort of UNO clone that I want to make multiplayer but it's just an abomination
					</p>
					<h3>Other Projects</h3>
					<p>
						I've been contributing to a number of other projects over the years, but the most prominent one is a project known as <a href="https://watercolorgames.itch.io/the-peacenet">The Peacenet</a> by Alkaline Thunder. His group, known as
						bit::phoenix("software"); are a great bunch of people working on a hacking game called The Peacenet. It has such a long history that I won't explain it in this about section, but I invite you to go to <a href="https://bitphoenixsoftware.com/">their website</a>
						to learn more.

						I hope you enjoyed learning a bit about me! :)
