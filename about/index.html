					<h1>I'm AShifter.</h1>
					<b>Hello! I'm AShifter. </b><span>I make things and put them on the internet, Including this website. This website showcases a few interesting projects I've been playing with. I'm extremely passionate about the work I do!</span>
					<br>

					<h3>MonoHack</h3>
					<p>
						MonoHack is an in-progress game engine built on MonoGame for use with hacking games and general game UI needs. It was born from the ashes of the old ShiftOS project from 2014
						and will hopefully live on to be the most versatile UI toolkit for MonoGame and XNA-based projects.
					</p>
					<h3>WaterBot</h3>
					<p>
						WaterBot is a Discord Bot. Simple! It's completely modular, and gets improved whenever I have the time to work on it. It can't compete with the likes of AstralMod and PrecipitationJS (yet!) 
						but I hope to get it there some day.
					</p>
					<h3>Other Projects</h3>
					<p>
						I've been contributing to a number of other projects over the years, but the most prominent one is a project known as <a href="https://watercolorgames.itch.io/the-peacenet">The Peacenet</a> by Alkaline Thunder. His group, known as
						bit::phoenix("software"); are a great bunch of people working on a hacking game called The Peacenet. It has such a long history that I won't explain it in this about section, but I invite you to go to <a href="https://bitphoenixsoftware.com/">their website</a>
						to learn more.

						I hope you enjoyed learning a bit about me! :)
